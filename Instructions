How to start

1. Install Git

2. Install a Git visual tool like: GitExtensions(https://gitextensions.github.io/), TortoiseGit(https://tortoisegit.org/) (or any other Git tool you prefer)
You can also use the git command line (git bash)

3. Create a Bitbucket account(https://bitbucket.org/) using your email adress provided to the laboratory

4. Clone the main OOP Laboratory repository
You have to pull the new version of it each time I add new materials to it, so that your local copy will also be updated.

5. Create your first private repository where you will add your solutions to the assignments
The structure of your repo will be the following one: name it using your LastName_FirstName and create inside it one folder for each lab and put inside the corresponding assignments you solved
